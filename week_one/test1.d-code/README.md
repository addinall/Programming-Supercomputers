This is the initial code presented in lab_one.
MODIFIED as per Lab 1. Part 3.

3: Write an external function add_external.c which has a function call 
           (double) add_external((double) a, (double(b))
    Modify test1.c to add another loop calling add_external() to perform the addition.
    Investigate the use of â€“ipo to inline this external call.
    What effect does this have on the vectorization of this loop?
