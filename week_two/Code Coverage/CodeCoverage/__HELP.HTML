Welcome to Intel&#174; Compilers code-coverage tool.
</h4>

<p>
Using the profile information gathered from running the 
instrumented binaries on an application's tests, Intel&#174; 
Compilers code-coverage tool creates HTML files that indicate 
which portions of the source code were, or were not, exercised 
by the tests. When applied to the profile of performance 
work-loads, the coverage information indicates how well
the training workload covers the application's critical code.

<h5 ALIGN="left" style="color:#3366ff">Coloring Scheme</h5>

<p>
The tool distinguishes between the covered code,
uncovered basic blocks, uncovered functions, and 
partially-covered code. There are default colors that the tool 
uses for highlighting the coverage information. These colors, 
however, can be customized to be any valid HTML color when the 
coverage tool is run to create the coverage report. For the 
results of this particular run that you are browsing now, 
the tool was configured with the following color settings. 
</p>

functions that were executed during the tests.</TD>

<h5 ALIGN="left" style="color:#3366ff">Dynamic Counters</h5>

<p> 
The coverage tool can be configured to generate the dynamic execution 
counts in addition to the coloring scheme which highlights the coverage 
information. The counts are displayed under the code after a 
<B>^</B> sign precisely under the source 
position where the corresponding basic block begins. If more than one 
basic block is generated for the code at a source position 
(e.g., for macros), then the total number of such blocks and the 
number of the blocks that were executed are also displayed in front of 
the execution count. For example, 
^ 1000 (8/10) means that ten blocks 
were generated for this position, however, only eight of them were 
executed with a total execution count of 1000.
</p>

<h5 ALIGN="left" style="color:#3366ff">Coverage Summary</h5>

<p>
The coverage tool creates two kinds of coverage summary. The top level 
summary reports the overall code coverage of the modules that were 
selected. Note that the tool provides an option through which one can 
select the modules of interest. The tool provides the list of all 
selected modules with their corresponding coverage information. 
The information includes the total number of functions and blocks in a 
module and the portions that were covered. By clicking on the title of 
columns in the reported tables, the lists may be sorted ascending or 
descending based on block coverage, function coverage, or function name. 
</p>

<p>
Similarly, within the individual module source views, the tool provides 
the list of uncovered functions as well as the list of covered functions. 
The lists are reported in two distinct frames that aid easy navigation 
of the source code. The lists can be sorted based on the number of blocks 
within uncovered functions and based on the block coverage in the case 
of covered functions.  Moreover, the lists can be sorted based on the 
function names.
