#Master Class: Programming on Supercomputers
##Charles Stuart University
###Mark Addinall -  June 2015
----
In this  master class you will learn how to program and maintain parallel systems. 
During the course you will have real time access to one of the worldâ€™s 
fastest super computers where you will run simulations, develop statistical 
learning systems, machine learning and learn to code simple bots.

Some of the areas covered will include:

- Porting code to the Xeon Phi
- Coding Linear Methods for Regression
- Model Assessment and Selection
- Additive Models, Trees and Related Methods
- Support Vector Machines and Flexible Discriminants
- Neural Networks
- Developing using Prototype Methods and Nearest Neighbours
- Clusters serve up a challenge
- Australian grid computing
- Gathering in Clusters
- Distributed Computing: Power Grid
- Thread Programming
- Parallel Computing Overview
- Cluster Computing: Introduction and System Architecture
- Parallel Programming Models and Paradigms
- MPI Programming  and Executing MPI using PBS
- Economic Scheduling Algorithms
- Programming in R on MIC systems
- C Programming on MIC (Xeon Phi)
- Issues with Cluster systems
- The future of HPC and parallel programming

The Lab work will mainly be based on code you will write, compile and configure using the C and C++ programming languages on the supercomputer accounts provided.
